# NodeMCU-RelayUnit

NodeMCU with a DC-DC power converter to allow it to be powered by up to 25VDC and a two-channel relay unit also leveraging the external power supply. The nodeMCU reads data from the [readiness.io](https://readiness.io/) service to decide whether to open and close the valves.

### Tutorial
We've put together a brief tutorial on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/NodeMCU-Relay-Controlled-Solenoid-Valve/) for how to setup the device.
